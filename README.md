This repository contains my raspberry pi projects:

1. ledblink: One of the basic raspberry pi projects for beginners. This python script makes an LED blink on and off every second. 

2. motorcontrol: So this is another simple project with the Raspberry Pi where I’ve controlled the direction of rotation (clockwise, anti-clockwise, stop) of DC Motor.

3. pushbuttonled: This is another simple beginner project where a LED tuns on as long as the push button is pressed.

4. time_controlled_car: So another simple and fun project! Here I’ve built a robocar that moves in forward direction for 4 sec and in backward direction for 4 sec.
